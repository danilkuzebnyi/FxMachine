## Description of my solution
When you click the *Reset* button the *URL* text field is cleared, and you can enter a new url.</br>
https://postman-echo.com is set as the default value in the *URL* field.

When you click the *Send* button **GET** request in progress, 
the window with progress bar is opened which indicates the progress of the request.
After that new *Result* window with the response is opened.

In the *Result* window you can enter data to the fields and click the *Send data* button.
When you click this button **POST** request is executed and the response is displayed 
at the top of this window instead of a response to a GET request.
