The aim of this project is to finish implementing different functionalities such as sending asynchronous get and post https requests.
The result of the request should be displayed in new window with it's own fxml scene.

Tasks:
    - add missing components used for sending get/post requests
    - add missing fxml scene and corresponding controller used for displaying the result
    - finish implementing RestApiAgent
    - send get/post https requests
    - in post request send arbitrary json, user will fill data in field
    - come up with potential changes/improvements for the application. It is allowed to add comments to code or to separate text file.

Advice:
    - use okhttp library located in pom file
    - fully utilize multithreading along with the display of progressbar/indicator so the window doesn't freeze
    - find and use arbitrary echo https server (for example postman-echo.com)
    - properly catch and implement exception states, it is allowed to use pre-configured library log4j
